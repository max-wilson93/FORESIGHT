```
 **Primary Role:** Handles **data analysis, feature engineering, machine learning training, and high-level orchestration**.  
 **Interoperability:** Python calls Rust functions for efficient execution and CUDA for AI acceleration.  

#### **Example â€“ Calling Rust & CUDA for High-Performance Computation**
```python
import rustlib
import cudalib

# Load high-frequency tick data using Rust
data = rustlib.load_market_data("tick_data.parquet")

# Run CUDA-optimized LSTM inference
predictions = cudalib.lstm_infer(data)
```
