# **Implementation Breakdown by Language**

## **Python – Machine Learning, Data Processing, and Orchestration**  
```
FORESIGHT/src/python/
│── data_pipeline.py         # Tick-level data ingestion & preprocessing
│── feature_engineering.py   # Feature creation for ML models
│── model_training.py        # Train LSTM, Transformer, and RL models
│── portfolio_analysis.py    # Evaluate portfolio returns and risk metrics
│── visualization.py         # Generate reports & charts
│── orchestration.py         # Manage execution flow (Python calling Rust/CUDA)
```
 **Primary Role:** Handles **data analysis, feature engineering, machine learning training, and high-level orchestration**.  
 **Interoperability:** Python calls Rust functions for efficient execution and CUDA for AI acceleration.  

#### **Example – Calling Rust & CUDA for High-Performance Computation**
```python
import rustlib
import cudalib

# Load high-frequency tick data using Rust
data = rustlib.load_market_data("tick_data.parquet")

# Run CUDA-optimized LSTM inference
predictions = cudalib.lstm_infer(data)
```

## **Rust – Trade Execution, Order Matching, and Portfolio Optimization**  
```
FORESIGHT/src/rust/
│── Cargo.toml               # Rust package manager file
│── src/
│   ├── lib.rs               # Main Rust library
│   ├── market_data.rs       # Tick-level data ingestion (via Arrow)

 **Primary Role:** Manages **trade execution, order book matching, and real-time market data handling**.  
 **Why Rust?** Unlike C++, Rust eliminates **memory errors and concurrency issues**, making it ideal for financial systems.  

#### **Example – Exposing Rust to Python**
```rust
#[pyfunction]
fn load_market_data(file: &str) -> PyResult<DataFrame> {
    let df = read_parquet(file)?;
    Ok(df)
}
```
