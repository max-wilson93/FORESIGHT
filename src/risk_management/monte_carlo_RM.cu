/**
 * Monte Carlo Simulations for Risk Management (CUDA)
 * 
 * Purpose:
 * This file implements GPU-accelerated Monte Carlo simulations for portfolio risk assessment.
 * It models the evolution of portfolio values under various market scenarios, enabling real-time
 * risk quantification and stress testing.
 * 
 * Role in FORESIGHT:
 * - Provides high-performance risk simulations for large portfolios.
 * - Integrates with the broader risk management pipeline.
 * - Supports decision-making in portfolio optimization and hedging.
 * 
 * Key Features:
 * - Parallelized simulations using CUDA.
 * - Antithetic variates for variance reduction.
 * - Multi-asset correlation support.
