/**
 * Real-Time Risk Monitoring (Rust)
 * 
 * Purpose:
 * This module monitors portfolio risk in real-time, computing metrics such as Value-at-Risk (VaR)
 * and stress test results. It integrates with the Monte Carlo simulations and scenario generation
 * tools.
 * 
 * Role in FORESIGHT:
 * - Provides real-time risk metrics for decision-making.
 * - Integrates with the execution engine for risk-aware trading.
 * - Supports regulatory compliance and reporting.
 * 
 * Key Features:
 * - Real-time risk computation.
 * - Integration with CUDA-accelerated simulations.
 * - Python bindings for seamless integration.
