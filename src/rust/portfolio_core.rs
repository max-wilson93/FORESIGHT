/**
 * Portfolio Management Core (Rust)
 * 
 * Purpose:
 * This module handles core portfolio computations, including performance attribution, risk-adjusted
 * returns, and optimization constraints. It integrates with the Markowitz and Black-Litterman models.
 * 
 * Role in FORESIGHT:
 * - Manages portfolio construction and optimization.
 * - Integrates with the risk management and execution engines.
 * - Supports real-time portfolio adjustments.
 * 
 * Key Features:
 * - Efficient portfolio computations.
 * - Integration with GPU-accelerated optimizations.
 * - Python bindings for seamless integration.
