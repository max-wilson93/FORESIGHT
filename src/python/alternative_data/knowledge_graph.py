Knowledge Graph Construction

Purpose:
This module builds a knowledge graph to map relationships between entities such as companies,
industries, and geopolitical events. The knowledge graph can be used to infer hidden market
signals and enhance predictive models.

Role in FORESIGHT:
- Provides a structured representation of relationships in financial markets.
- Enhances predictive models by incorporating relational data.
- Integrates with the broader financial forecasting pipeline.

Key Features:
- Entity extraction and relationship mapping.
- Graph construction using libraries like NetworkX or PyTorch Geometric.
- Integration with external data sources (e.g., news, earnings reports).
