Satellite Data Processing

Purpose:
This module processes satellite imagery data to extract insights relevant to financial markets.
For example, it can analyze parking lot occupancy to predict retail sales or monitor crop health
to forecast agricultural commodity prices.

Role in FORESIGHT:
- Integrates satellite data into the broader financial forecasting pipeline.
- Provides alternative data insights that complement traditional financial data.
- Enhances predictive models by incorporating real-world, high-frequency data.

Key Features:
- Image processing and feature extraction.
- Integration with APIs like Planet Labs or Google Earth Engine.
- Data preprocessing for machine learning models.
