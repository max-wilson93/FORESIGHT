/**
 * Latency Benchmarking for Trade Execution (Rust)
 * 
 * Purpose:
 * This module benchmarks the latency of the trade execution engine, including order placement,
 * matching, and execution. It ensures that the system meets the ultra-low-latency requirements
 * for high-frequency trading.
 * 
 * Role in FORESIGHT:
 * - Quantifies the performance of the execution engine.
 * - Identifies bottlenecks in the order processing pipeline.
 * - Ensures compliance with latency requirements.
 * 
 * Key Features:
 * - Measures end-to-end latency for trade execution.
 * - Simulates high-frequency trading scenarios.
 * - Provides detailed performance reports.
